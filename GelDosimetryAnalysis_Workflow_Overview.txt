Workflow overview:
1.  Loading planning image (PLANCT) and a planned dose distribution (PLANDOSE)
2.  Load a cone-beam CT scan (CBCT)
3.  Register it to PLANCT
4.  Transform PLANDOSE using result transform (to CBCT coordinate frame)
5.  Load 3D optical CT scan of the gel, or a 2D scan of the film. (MEASURED)
6.  Register MEASURED to CBCT using fiducial marks, using rigid transform
7.  Transform MEASURED using result transform (to CBCT coordinate frame)
8.  Load Percent Depth Dose data (two-column spreadsheet)
9.  Load experimental CALIBRATION 3D optical CT scan from VFF file
10. Get mean optical densities from the central cylinder of the CALIBRATION volume
11. Align PDD curve with the curve resulting from step 10
12. Calibrate PDD data using RDF and electron MU values input by the user
13. Fit polynomial on the optical density vs. dose curve (resulting from the aligned calibration curves)
14. Perform a gamma, chi, etc. test between MEASURED and PLANDOSE, yielding another 3D volume COMPARISON
15. Extract statistics from COMPARISON
